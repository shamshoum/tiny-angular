# Tiny-Angular

### This is a simple angular project template

Best use scenarios:

 * This is a small app
 * You want to try a new angular plugin

After cloning the project:
    * Do bower install (Need for different angular plugins)
    * Do npm install (To install gulp)

Some notes:

    * The app comes ready with [material design](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/) support and [bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) support.
    * To initialize the use of either you need to uncomment some lines in index.html file
    * The app comes with a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) file that creates a single js file ready to use with controllers and everything in /js folder.
    * You can also work without gulp but you will need to import the need js file manually
